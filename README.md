# Technical Information
.NET MAUI: .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a modern cross-platform framework for building native user interfaces across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android using a single codebase. It provides a unified development experience and leverages the power of Xamarin and .NET 7 to create stunning and performant applications.

.NET 7: .NET 7 is the latest version of the .NET runtime and SDK, which brings new features, performance improvements, and language enhancements. It offers cutting-edge capabilities for building modern applications, including support for native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, hot reload, and performance optimizations.

Refit Client: Refit is a library that simplifies making HTTP requests in .NET applications by providing a type-safe REST client interface. It allows developers to define APIs as C# interfaces and handles the underlying HTTP communication transparently. In this app, Refit is used to interact with TheCocktailDB.com API and retrieve drink data.
